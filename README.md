# Hey, welcome to my github page! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Remus**, and I'm currently a student at the University of Guelph, pursuing a degree in Honours Computer Science. Lately I've been getting a lot of experience with **Web development** and **C programming**, if you're intrested in looking at my projects I'd recommend checking out the **Scrape Mega** first!
